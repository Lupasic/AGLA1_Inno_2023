\begin{enumerate}

  \item Find the equation of the cone with its vertex at $(1,1,1)$ and which passes through the curve $x^2+y^2=4, z =2$.

  \item Find the equation of the cone with its vertex at the origin, which passes through the curve $ax^2+by^2+cz^2-1=0= \alpha x^2 - \beta y^2 - 2z$.
  
  \item Find the equation of the cone, which passes through the axes.
  
  \item Find the equation of the right circular cone whose vertex is at the origin, whose axis is the line $\frac{x}{1}=\frac{y}{2}=\frac{z}{3}$ and which has a vertical angle of $60^\circ$.
  
  \item Find the equation of the cylinder whose generators are parallel to the line $\frac{x}{-1}=\frac{y}{2}=\frac{z}{3}$ and whose directional curve is $x^2+y^2=9, z=1$.
  
  \item Find the equations of the right circular cylinder of radius $3$ with equations of axis as  $\frac{x-1}{2}=\frac{y-3}{2}=\frac{z-5}{-1}$.
  
  \item Find the equation of the enveloping cylinder of the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2-2x+4y=1$ having its generators parallel to the line $x=y=z$.
  
  \item   Find the equation of the cone whose vertex is at the origin and which passes through the curve of intersection of the plane $lx+my+nz=p$ and surface, $ax^2+by^2+cz^2=1$.

\textbf{Ans}: $p^2(ax^2+by^2+cz^2)=(lx+my+nz)^2$

\item Find the equation to the cone whose vertex is the origin and the base circle $x=a, y^2+z^2=b^2$ and show that the section of the cone by a plane parallel to the $xy$-plane is hyperbola.

\textbf{Ans}: $a^2(y^2+z^2)=b^2x^2$

\item  Find the equation of the cylinder, whose directional curve is $x^2+z^2-4x-2z+4=0, y =0$ and whose axis contains the point $(0,3,0)$. 

\textbf{Ans}: $10x^2+5y^2+13z^2+12xy+4xz+6yz-36x-30y-18z+36=0$
